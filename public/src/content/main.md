## About

I am a self-taught web developer with a background in art and art history. On paper those things seem disconnected, but the knowledge I gained in both practices have been critical in my development. My interest in art and education led me to volunteer my time to improve the website of a local arts center. In return, that time led me to a career in web development,  something I love.

Since the beginning I have continued the ongoing process of learning and have built a personal library of development knowledge. I am always excited to take on new challenges that let me expand and share that set of tools.

### What I have learned from...

#### Art

My fine art practice focused on the lost-wax, bronze-casting technique. Similar to web development each step builds on the previous one—from creating a clay model to finishing the bronze—if you don't understand all the steps in the process, you jeopardize the final product. Working in this tradition taught me to be aware of each action and it's role in the project, ensuring the best result for the client and their customers.

#### Art History

Hours of research are the backbone for a great art historian, in the same way that hours of online research result in great development. If you run into a problem in your work, the solution is just a search away. And if that search turns up nothing, you celebrate because you just found your focus or thesis. Even when the result isn't out there yet, the solution becomes a synthesis of existing ideas to solve your problem. Dedication, time, and a few breaks can lead to great results.

#### Failure

The first couple of flops (some still floating around the interwebs) are hard. Each time I wanted to walk away and give up but I soon realized that those were the best moments to learn from. Now I embrace mistakes and let them educate my next steps.

### Goals

* Responsive Design

* Accessibility

* SEO/SEM

## Projects

### JohnRitterbush.com

#### var self = this;

This site is a testament to the full-stack nature of how I work. It starts with Vagrant and Ansible for local development and provisioning for the staging/production servers. Add in npm/bower/gulp to automate the build of the site including styles generated using SCSS with dependencies on Bootstrap. All wrapped neatly in version-controlled repositories for the server and the site itself. From zero to full site in a few commands.

Tags: HTML/CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Ansible, Vagrant, Gulp, Git, Node, Bower

### Van Gogh's Bedrooms

#### Promotional Site

The site was created to to pique interest in the exhibition *Van Gogh’s Bedrooms *for the Art Institute of Chicago. The marketing team needed landing pages to compliment the ad campaign around the city and also a place for visitors to go and see materials they may have missed during their visit. We combined style guides from the marketing campaign with digital and print assets in the exhibition, to provide the visitor with an online resource that reflected their experience at the museum.

### Van Gogh's Bedrooms

#### Angular Quiz

A compliment to the *Van Gogh’s Bedroom *website, this quiz lets visitors test their knowledge of Van Gogh in pop culture. They can share their results on social media, engaging more interest and potential visitors to the exhibition.

### Find your #ArtThrob

#### Custom JavaScript Quiz

As a Valentine’s Day social media promotion, I collaborated with the social media manager to create a Buzzfeed-style quiz that would use the answers to identify a visitors love interest. It was a fun way for the museum to engage with it’s social media followers who could take the quiz and then share with their friends.

### Drupal Updates

#### Zzzzzzzzzz.

While not as exciting as the other items on the list, making sure the latest security patches are applied to a site running on Drupal is critical. I stay tuned into the Drupal updates to ensure the latest and greatest is always running. Also important in this process is to talk to the content producers to find out which areas of the admin need feature enhancements and bug fixes.

Tags: Drupal, PHP, Git, Drush

### Additional Projects

* Site Testing: Using a local server running PhantomJS and CasperJS, I built out tests for various sections of our site to ensure updates to the code or database didn't break functionality. Tests run on local development, staging and production servers to check at all levels of deployment.Tags: JavaScript, Node, Bower, Grunt, PhantomJS, CasperJS

* Freelance: Converted fixed-width Wordpress themes to responsive layout. Improved accessibility on mobile devices and helped pass Google's Mobile Friendly Test.Tags: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Wordpress, Git, Gulp

* Playground: Sometimes it's fun just to tinker around. I've recently started playing with FreeCodeCamp to give me some things to work on for fun. Nothing serious, just a place to try out an idea or explore a library/framework for future consideration. Check my codepen.io for some of these: [http://codepen.io/jritterbush](http://codepen.io/jritterbush).

## Skills

### HTML5

I make it a priority to write semantic markup which not only improves accessibility and findability, but also makes for more future-friendly code.

### CSS3

Using CSS to improve layout and animations helps minimize the need for JavaScript.

### CSS Precompilers

I am familiar with LESS and SASS preprocessing as well as using tools like Autoprefixer to make CSS compatiable with as many browsers as possible.

### CMS/CMF

I have worked with a variety of content management systems and frameworks. The bulk of that work revolves around Drupal and Wordpress.

### JavaScript

I have focused lately on vanilla JavaScript for front-end scripting, but also integrating tools like jQuery and underscore, MV* frameworks like AngularJS and Backbone, and templating tools like Mustache and dÅmo.

### Automation

Tools like Vagrant and Ansible for server automation plus scripting automation from NPM, Bower, Gulp, and Grunt, have made continuous deployment much less of a chore. I use these tools every chance I get.

### Server-Side Languages

I maintain and develop projects mainly in PHP and Ruby, but have also worked on small projects with ASP and Python.

### Databases

My primary database of choice has been MySQL for ease-of-use and compatibility, but have worked with Microsoft SQL and NoSQL databases like RethinkDB.
