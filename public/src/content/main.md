## Full Stack Developer, UI/UX Consultant

I'm a full-stack, web developer currently employed at the Art Institute of Chicago. When I'm not full stacking for them, I do freelance web development and consulting for digital projects.

## About

I am a self-taught developer that comes from a background of art and art history. On paper those things seem disconnected, the reality is that the tools I learned in both practices have been critical in my development. My interest in art led me to volunteer my time to improve the website of a local arts education group which is what helped me realize it was something I enjoyed doing.

Since those early day, I've been adding more skills and knowledge to my personal library and I am always excited to take on a new project that lets me both share that knowledge and pick up even more new tools.

### What I learned along the way from...

#### Art

My artstic background focuses on the lost-wax, bronze-casting technique. This techniques has changed little over the centuries, so knowing the process is where the challenge lies here. Just like a full-stack developer, you need to understand how each step builds on the previous ones. Creating the armature, modeling the clay, making a mold of the piece, creating the wax impression, layering the ceramic shell, melting out the wax, and casting the bronze. All of these steps depend on the previous so if you don't understand the process of one step, you jeopardize the final product. Working in this tradition has helped me as a developer to keep a watchful eye on each step of the process and ensuring that the end result is the best result for the client and their customers.


#### Art History

Many hours in the library with nearly endless research are the backbone for great art historians. If nothing else, my background in art history has taught me the key elements of research. If you run into a problem in your work, the solution is just a search away. And if that search turns up nothing, you celebrate because you just found your focus and thesis. Even when that result isn't out there, the solution becomes a synthesis of existing ideas to solve your problem. Dedication, time, and a few breaks can lead to great results.


#### Failure

The first couple of real bombs (some still floating around the interwebs as we speak) were hard. I wanted to walk away and give up. I shouldn't be here, I thought. Gradually, though, I realized that those were the real moments to get better at what I do. It definitely seems cliche looking back, but the best learning moments were by far the biggest flops.

#### Inheritance

No, I'm not talking about money here. Inheriting legacy code can be a real drag. You want to jump forward into tomorrow, but yesterday is clinging to the heel of your shoe. This struggle exists in even some of the newest companies out there, but it doesn't have to be all bad. You can learn a lot from progressively enhancing some old JavaScript or converting that CSS jumble into SCSS. It forces you to really consider what you think is the best solution and then apply it more strategically to your existing codebase. But you can still complain while doing it.

## Projects


### JohnRitterbush.com
#### var self = this;

You are looking at it. This site is a testament to the full-stack nature of my work. It starts with Vagrant and Ansible for local development and provisioning for the staging/production servers. Add in `npm`/`bower`/`gulp` to automate the build of the site including styles generated using SCSS with dependencies on Bootstrap. All wrapped neatly version-controlled in repos for the server and the site itelf. From zero to full site in a few commands.

### Drupal Updates
#### Zzzzzzzzzz.

While not as exciting as the other items on the list, making sure the latest security patches are applied to a site running on Drupal is critical. I stay tuned into the Drupal updates to ensure the latest and greatest is always running. Also important in this process is to talk to the content producers to find out which areas of the admin need feature enhancements and bug fixes.

### Additional Projects

* Site Testing: Using a local server running PhantomJS and CasperJS, I built out tests for various sections of our site to ensure updates to the code or database didn't break functionality. Tests run on local development, staging and production servers to check at all levels of deployment.
  * Tags: JavaScript, Node, Bower, Grunt, PhantomJS, CasperJS
* Freelance: Converted fixed-width Wordpress themes to responsive layout. Improved accessibility on mobile devices and helped pass Google's Mobile Friendly Test.
  * Tags: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Wordpress, Git, Gulp
* Playground: Sometimes it's fun just to tinker around. I've recently started playing with FreeCodeCamp to give me some things to work on for fun. Nothing serious, just a place to try out an idea or explore a library/framework for future consideration. Check my codepen.io for some of these: http://codepen.io/jritterbush.
