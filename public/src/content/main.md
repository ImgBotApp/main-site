## About

I am a self-taught web developer that comes from a background of art and art history. On paper those things seem disconnected, the reality is that the tools I learned in both practices have been critical in my development. It was my interest in art and education that led me to volunteer to improve the website of a local arts center. That time spent led me to a career doing something I love.

Since those early day, I continue to add skills and knowledge to my personal library. I am always excited to take on new challenges that let me expand and share that set of tools.


### What I have learned from...

#### Art

My artstic background focuses on the lost-wax, bronze-casting technique. Just like full-stack development each step builds on the previous one. Creating an armature, modeling in clay, making a mold, creating a wax impression, layering ceramic shell, melting the wax, and casting and finishing the bronze. If you don't understand the process and previous steps, you jeopardize the final product. Working in this tradition has taught me to be aware of each step and it's role in the project, ensuring the best result for the client and their customers.


#### Art History

Hours of research in the library are the backbone for a great art historian, in the same way that hours of online research result in great development. If you run into a problem in your work, the solution is just a search away. And if that search turns up nothing, you celebrate because you just found your focus or thesis. Even when that result isn't out there, the solution becomes a synthesis of existing ideas to solve your problem. Dedication, time, and a few breaks can lead to great results.


#### Failure

The first couple of flops (some still floating around the interwebs, as we speak) are hard. Each time I wanted to walk away and give up. Gradually I realized that those were the best moments to learn from. Now I embrace the mistakes and let them educate my next steps.

#### Inheritance

Inheriting legacy code can be a real drag. We all want to jump forward into tomorrow, but yesterday is clinging to the heel of our shoe. This struggle doesn't have to be all bad. I have learned a lot from progressively enhancing some old JavaScript or converting that CSS jumble into SCSS. This process forced me to consider what is best and then apply it strategically to my enhancements. That said, we still get to complain while doing it.

### Goals 

* Responsive Design
* Accessibility
* SEO/SEM

## Projects


### JohnRitterbush.com
#### var self = this;

You are looking at it. This site is a testament to the full-stack nature of my work. It starts with Vagrant and Ansible for local development and provisioning for the staging/production servers. Add in `npm`/`bower`/`gulp` to automate the build of the site including styles generated using SCSS with dependencies on Bootstrap. All wrapped neatly version-controlled in repos for the server and the site itelf. From zero to full site in a few commands.

### Drupal Updates
#### Zzzzzzzzzz.

While not as exciting as the other items on the list, making sure the latest security patches are applied to a site running on Drupal is critical. I stay tuned into the Drupal updates to ensure the latest and greatest is always running. Also important in this process is to talk to the content producers to find out which areas of the admin need feature enhancements and bug fixes.

### Additional Projects

* Site Testing: Using a local server running PhantomJS and CasperJS, I built out tests for various sections of our site to ensure updates to the code or database didn't break functionality. Tests run on local development, staging and production servers to check at all levels of deployment.
  * Tags: JavaScript, Node, Bower, Grunt, PhantomJS, CasperJS
* Freelance: Converted fixed-width Wordpress themes to responsive layout. Improved accessibility on mobile devices and helped pass Google's Mobile Friendly Test.
  * Tags: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Wordpress, Git, Gulp
* Playground: Sometimes it's fun just to tinker around. I've recently started playing with FreeCodeCamp to give me some things to work on for fun. Nothing serious, just a place to try out an idea or explore a library/framework for future consideration. Check my codepen.io for some of these: http://codepen.io/jritterbush.

## Skills

### HTML5 

I make it a priority to write semantic markup which not only improves accessibility and findability, but also makes for more future-friendly code.

### CSS3

Using CSS to improve layout and animations helps minimize the need for JavaScript.

### CSS Precompilers

I am familiar with LESS and SASS preprocessing as well as using tools like Autoprefixer to make CSS compatiable with as many browsers as possible.

### CMS/CMF 

I have worked with a variety of content management systems and frameworks. The bulk of that work revolves around Drupal and Wordpress.

### JavaScript

I have focused lately on vanilla JavaScript for front-end scripting, but also integrating tools like jQuery and underscore, MV* frameworks like AngularJS and Backbone, and templating tools like Mustache and d≈çmo.

### Automation

Tools like Vagrant and Ansible for server automation plus scripting automation from NPM, Bower, Gulp, and Grunt, have made continuous deployment much less of a chore. I use these tools every chance I get.

### Server-Side Languages 

I maintain and develop projects mainly in PHP and Ruby, but have also worked on small projects with ASP and Python.

### Databases

My primary database of choice has been MySQL for ease-of-use and compatibility, but have worked with Microsoft SQL and NoSQL databases like RethinkDB.
